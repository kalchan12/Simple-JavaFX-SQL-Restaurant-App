# üçΩÔ∏è  Simple JavaFX + SQL Restaurant App

Long before AI took over the scene, I built this small **JavaFX** project as a 2nd-year CS student.  
It‚Äôs a simple restaurant application that lets users **browse menu items, simulate payments**, and **log all orders into a SQL database**.

> üí° This is *simple but honest work* ‚Äî built with love, coffee, and plenty of student determination.
